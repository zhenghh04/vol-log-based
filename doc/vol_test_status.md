## The Log VOL connector API compatibility

This file contains the current status of the Log VOL connector on the official hdf5 vol test suit.

The test ran on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS with MPICH 3.3.2 and HDF5 1.13.0.
gcc 9.3.0 was used to compile HDF5, log-layout based VOL, and the vol-tests suit.

### Status
* Pass
  + vol-test suit reports no error in the section
* Fail
  + vol-test suit reports at least one error in the section
* Skip
  + Test section being skipped manually due to features not supported by the Log VOL connector
* Not tested
  + Sections not yet tested
