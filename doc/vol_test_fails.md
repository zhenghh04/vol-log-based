## Current Status of Testing with HDF5 VOL Tests

This file summarize the result running [vol-tests](https://github.com/HDFGroup/vol-tests) using the current version of log-layout based VOL.
The test ran on commit 3eb0a434fcede20673a53b0b1cd845f0a30e104b of vol-tests.

The test ran on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS with MPICH 3.3.2 and HDF5 1.13.0.
gcc 9.3.0 was used to compile HDF5, log-layout based VOL, and the vol-tests suit.
